    	<center><p>The sapphire waves gently wash upon the sands as white as marble. A distant symphony of tropical birdsongs rouses you from contemplation. As you gaze into the amber sunset, you wonder how you can possibly be standing hundreds of miles from Africaâ€™s coastline.</p></center>

    	<center><p>As the sun rises, take to the mirror-like waters of Lake Albert, and search for the coveted shoebill stork in the marshy shorelines. Continue exploring with mountain biking over craggy hills, and end the day with a magical bush dinner and a night game drive.</p></center>

    	<center><p>Protruding from translucent water, luscious stepped hills provide a natural staircase leading you to some of the best views in Uganda. Formed over 10,000 years ago, when a river was dammed by lava, Lake Bunyonyi is rich with history and bird song.</p></center>
